description: Learn how to validate your stepper with any schema library
---

Stepperize provides a way to add schemas to your steps with any schema library.

Let's see how we can create our validation schemas and have them within our stepper.

## Zod

```tsx twoslash
import { z } from "zod";
import { defineStepper } from "@stepperize/react";

const Schema = z.object({
  email: z.string().email(),
  password: z.string().min(8),
});

type MyFormValues = z.infer<typeof Schema>;

const stepperInstance = defineStepper({
  id: "personal",
  label: "Personal Information",
  schema: Schema,
});
```

## ValiBot

```tsx twoslash
import * as v from "valibot";
import { defineStepper } from "@stepperize/react";

const Schema = v.object({
  email: v.pipe(v.string(), v.email()),
  password: v.pipe(v.string(), v.minLength(8)),
});

type MyFormValues = v.InferInput<typeof Schema>;

const stepperInstance = defineStepper({
  id: "personal",
  label: "Personal Information",
  schema: Schema,
});
```

## ArkType

```tsx twoslash
import { type } from "arktype";
import { defineStepper } from "@stepperize/react";

const Schema = type({
  email: "string.email",
  password: "string >= 8",
});

type MyFormValues = typeof Schema.infer;

const stepperInstance = defineStepper({
  id: "personal",
  label: "Personal Information",
  schema: Schema,
});
```

## Working with multiple schemas and steps

Let's say we have a series of steps in the form of forms, each of which has a validation schema. All you have to do is add the schemas with the key of your choice, and that's it.

Let's see how it works in a practical example with Zod.

```tsx twoslash
import { z } from "zod";
import { defineStepper } from "@stepperize/react";

const FirstStepSchema = z.object({
  name: z.string().min(1),
  lastName: z.string().min(1),
});

const SecondStepSchema = z.object({
  email: z.string().email(),
  password: z.string().min(8),
});

const ThirdStepSchema = z.object({});

const stepperInstance = defineStepper(
  {
    id: "personal-info",
    label: "Personal Information",
    schema: FirstStepSchema,
  },
  {
    id: "account",
    label: "Account Information",
    schema: SecondStepSchema,
  },
  {
    id: "complete",
    label: "Complete",
    schema: ThirdStepSchema,
  }
);
```

<Callout type="info">
  You've probably noticed that the last step has an empty schema. This is
  because stepperize infers all the steps, and when you want to send your
  `currentStep.schema`, one of them could be undefined. To avoid this, you can
  simply add an empty schema. Or, if you prefer, you can choose not to do this
  and validate for yourself whether the schema exists.
