# Simplifying Multi-Step Processes in React

Stepperize is a versatile React library designed to streamline the creation of Stepper components. It empowers developers to build complex, multi-step processes with ease, allowing them to focus on business logic rather than implementation details.

## Key Features

- **Type-Safe Primitives**: Fully typed components for building accessible stepper UIs
- **Flexible Step Management**: Navigate with next/prev/goTo and optional `onBeforeTransition` / `onAfterTransition` callbacks to validate or run logic on step change
- **Headless Component**: Full control over styling and UI
- **React Native Compatible**: Build steppers for web and mobile apps
- **Conditional Rendering**: Step-based content with `flow.switch()`, `Stepper.Content`, or `flow.is(id)`
- **State Management**: Built-in tools for handling step state, metadata, and status
- **Async Support**: Optional async onBeforeTransition / onAfterTransition callbacks


## Core Concepts

### Thinking in Steps

Steppers break down complex workflows into manageable chunks, providing:

- Clear navigation between steps
- Visual progress indicators
- Improved user experience for multi-stage processes

**Common Use Cases**

- User onboarding
- Multi-page forms
- E-commerce checkout
- Product creation wizards
- Tutorial walkthroughs
- Surveys and questionnaires
- Booking systems

### Thinking in Flows

Stepperize goes beyond linear progressions, enabling:

- Conditional rendering
- Branching paths
- Dynamic form adjustments
- Personalized user experiences
- State-dependent UI changes
- Multi-path processes

Use `stepper.flow.switch({ stepId: () => <Panel /> })` or `stepper.flow.is('payment')` to render by step.
