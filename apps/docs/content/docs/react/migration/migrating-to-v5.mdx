<Callout type="warn">
  For the latest migration guide (v5 to v6), see [Migrating to v6](./migrating-to-v6).
</Callout>

In v6 the config was simplified again: `useStepper` and `Scoped` now take `initialStep` and `initialMetadata` at the top level (no `initial` object), and initial `statuses` were removed (status is derived from position). If you are on v5 and upgrading to v6, follow the [v6 migration guide](./migrating-to-v6) instead.

Stepperize v5 adds a new `metadata` API to the `useStepper` hook

## Breaking Changes

### Name changes in the values returned by the hook

Now the parameters of useStepper are not a string indicating the initial step, but rather an object with the `initial` property:

```tsx
const methods = useStepper({
  initial: {
    step: "first",        // The ID of the initial step to display
    metadata: { ... },    // The initial metadata for each step
    statuses: { ... },    // The initial status for each step
  }
});
```

## New Features

### New `metadata` API

The `metadata` API allows you to set dynamic metadata for each step.
