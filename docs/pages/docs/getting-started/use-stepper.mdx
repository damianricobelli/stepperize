# useStepper Hook

The `useStepper` hook provides access to the stepper actions within a `Stepper` to be able to interact with the stepper and create our own custom logic.

In the [API Reference](#api-reference) section you can find the full list of properties you can use.

One of the most interesting properties of the hook is the `when` property that allows you to render a component when the stepper is in a specific step or when the stepper has finished.

For example:

```tsx
const { when } = useStepper();

when("first").render(() => <p>This is the first step</p>);
```

As you can see, you can render a component when the stepper is in a specific step through the parameter that receives the `when` function followed by the `render` method.

You can see a complete example [here](our-first-stepper.mdx).

## API Reference

The `useStepper` hook returns an object with the following properties:

<PropsTable

      name: "steps",
      typeSimple: "Step[]",
      description: "The array of steps",

    },
